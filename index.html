<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Tud Apt Works</strong> built the <strong>Minesweeper but Smooth</strong> app as an <strong>Ad Supported</strong> app. This Service is provided by Tud Apt Works at no cost and is intended for use as is.</p>

<p>This app includes an optional in-app purchase that allows users to remove advertisements. The purchase is processed securely through the App Store, and we do not have access to your payment information.</p>

<p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information if anyone decides to use our Service.</p>

<p>If you choose to use our Service, you agree to the processing of information in relation to this policy. We do <strong>not</strong> collect or store personal data directly. However, the app may use third-party services that collect information used to identify you in order to display advertising.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

<p>For a better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide certain information indirectly through third-party services such as Google AdMob. These third parties may collect and use identifiers, IP address, and device data to show personalized or non-personalized ads.</p>

<p>The app uses the following third-party service provider that may collect information used to identify you:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AdMob</a></li>
</ul>

<p>On iOS devices, the app may request permission to track user activity across other companies' apps and websites through Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework. This prompt is managed entirely by Apple's system. Whether you allow or deny tracking, the app will continue to function normally. Your choice affects whether ads are personalized.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Log Data</h2>

<p>Whenever you use our Service, if an error occurs in the app we may collect data and information (through third-party products) called <em>Log Data</em>. This may include details such as your device's IP address, device name, operating system version, configuration of the app, time and date of your use, and other statistics.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Cookies</h2>

<p>This Service does not use cookies explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use "cookies" to collect information and improve their services. You can choose to accept or refuse cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. Refusing cookies may limit certain features provided by third parties.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Service Providers</h2>

<p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
  <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
  <li>To perform Service-related functions; or</li>
  <li>To assist in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
</ul>

<p>These third parties have access to user information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>We value your trust in using our app. While we do not collect personal information directly, the third-party services we use (such as Google AdMob) follow industry-standard methods to protect user data. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100 % secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

<hr>

<h2>In-App Purchases</h2>

<p>Minesweeper but Smooth offers an optional in-app purchase to remove ads. All purchases are handled by the App Store and processed using Apple's secure payment system. We do not collect or store any payment details such as credit card numbers or billing addresses. Transaction receipts are managed by Apple and may be used solely to verify your purchase status within the app (for example, to determine whether ads should be shown).</p>

<hr>

<h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>

<p>This Service may contain links to other websites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us, and we have no control over their content or privacy practices. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of any such website.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>These Services are not directed toward anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided personal information, we will delete it immediately. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us personal information, please contact us so that we can take the necessary actions.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Your Privacy Rights</h2>

<p>You have rights regarding your personal data. Since we don't store or process data directly, please contact our third-party provider (Google AdMob) for data-related requests.
You may also contact us at tudaptworks@outlook.com, and we'll help forward or clarify your request.</p>

<p>EU and UK users can also review or update their ad consent preferences at any time through the in-app consent form presented by Google AdMob.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Any updates will be posted on this page.</p>
